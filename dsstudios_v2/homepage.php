Hey there, welcome on my site. My name is <span>Sameera Kaluwaduge</span>, Sam for friends. I'm studying electronic and telecommunication at ISS G. Giorgi in <span>Milan, Italy</span>, but have a great passion for the <span>web design</span> and <span>graphic design</span>. I try to keep my own minimalist style for what I design and never lose passion for what I love to do. My work is produced with great <span>attention to detail</span>, <span>expressive typography</span> and <br/> <span>clear communication</span>.
I enjoy taking on new projects. If you have anything in mind, please don't hesitate to <span>contact me</span> to discuss your ideas.
                    </p>
